[The Art of C++] / Config is a C++ header-only library that reads config files in a format based on [JSON] and [JAXN] and produces a single [JSON Value] as result.

## Documentation

 * [Changelog](doc/Changelog.md)
 * [Version 1.x](doc/README.md) (requires C++17)

## Contact

For questions and suggestions regarding The Art of C++ / Config, success or failure stories, and any other kind of feedback, please feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/taocpp/config/discussions), an [issue](https://github.com/taocpp/config/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/taocpp/config/pulls) on GitHub or contact the authors at `taocpp(at)icemx.net`.

## Introduction

 * [JAXN] syntax with extensions (backward compatible with [JSON]).
 * [JAXN] data model ([JSON] extended with binary data and non-finites).
 * Meta data, all sub-values are annotated with filename and position.
 * Copy, reference, replace and delete anything in the [JSON] structure.
 * Multiple ways to read and include other config and data files, and
 * use environment variables and the output of arbitrary shell commands.
 * The function [`tao::config::from_file()`](doc/Parsing-Config-Files.md) is all you need to get going.

Every JSON file with a top-level object can be used as [config file](doc/Writing-Config-Files.md).

```
{
   "ip": "127.0.0.2",
   "port": 27960,
   "maps": [ "ztn", "dm13", "t9" ]
}
```

This small example can be rendered differently using some of the additional syntactic possibilities of the [config file](doc/Writing-Config-Files.md) format.

```
#!/usr/local/bin/q3s

ip = "127.0.0.2"
port = 27960
maps = [ "ztn" "dm13" "t9" ]  // Add dm6 or t4?
```

Semantic features like [deleting](doc/Writing-Config-Files.md#delete) and [referencing](doc/Writing-Config-Files.md#references) values, or [including files](doc/Writing-Config-Filesmd#include-files) and [reading environment variables](doc/All-Config-Functions.md#env), usually only make sense with larger, non-trivial real-world examples.

These features can be used to manage situations that go beyond single deployments with a single config, for example providing the tools to manage configuration templates that are adapted to different environments.

[Parsing](doc/Parsing-Config-Files.md) a [config file](doc/Writing-Config-Files.md) is as simple as calling the appropriate `from_file()` function with the filename.

```
#include <tao/config.hpp>

const tao::config::value config = tao::config::from_file( "foo.cfg" );
```

The resulting value is nothing other but a [JSON Value] from [taoJSON] with a custom traits class that annotates every sub-value with the filename and position it was parsed from.
It can be inspected -- and manipulated -- using all the facilities of that JSON library.
