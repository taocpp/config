* Change the semantics of star and move evaluation to phase two.
* Refactor everything in order to simplify the implementation.
* Syntactically turn `delete` and `temporary` into literal pseudo-values.
* More intuitive semantics requires less knowledge of implementation details.
* Change the semantics to perform nested additions by default.
